# VBA Scripting Challenge
In this challenge I will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

1. The VBA script loops through one year of stock data and reads/stores all of the following values for each row:
-Ticker symbol
-Volume of stock
-Opening price
-Closing price

2. On the same worksheet as the raw data, the script creates columns for the following:
-Ticker symbol
-Total stock volume
-Yearly change ($)
-Percentage change (%)

Conditional formatting is applied to the yearly change and percentage change columns and colour coded:
-Green for positive change
-Red for negative change

The script calculates and displays the following values:
-Greatest % Increase
-Greatest % Decrease
-Greatest Total Volume

The VBA script is designed to run on all worksheets and analyze multiple years of stock data.
